# Mini-Project on Supply Chain Simulation

## Introduction

This mini-project aims to familiarize users with MATLAB/SIMULINK tools, particularly the **Z-TRANSFORM Toolbox**. We will explore discrete functions that are essential for modeling sales demand using blocks such as **DELAY** and **DESCRIPTION FILTER**.

The project focuses on discrete signal processing, which is crucial for understanding control systems in automation. We will model complex supply chains using simple models in Simulink while introducing key concepts like transfer functions.

## Objectives

- Understand and apply Z-TRANSFORM in the context of supply chain management.
- Visualize the relationships between stock, demand, orders, shipments, and other key variables (Net Stock, Work In Process, Inventory Position, etc.).
- Discover important concepts such as reorder points and lead time quantile forecasts.

## Project Files

- **mini-project-report.pdf**: A detailed report outlining methodologies and results.
- **scm.m**: MATLAB script containing the simulation code.
- **scm.slx**: Simulink model used for the simulation.
- **Slides.pdf**: Visual presentation of the results and concepts covered.

## Installation and Usage

1. **MATLAB and Simulink** must be installed on your machine.
2. Open the `scm.slx` file in Simulink to explore the model.
3. Run the `scm.m` script to initiate the simulation and obtain results.

## Conclusion

This project is an excellent opportunity to learn how to manage complex systems in the field of supply chain using MATLAB and Simulink while applying automation concepts to optimize process regulation.
